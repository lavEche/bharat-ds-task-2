# Titanic Classification System
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()

Overview
The Titanic Classification System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or not, based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and how to use it.

### Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. titanic_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
2. data/: Directory containing the Titanic dataset.
3. images/: Directory containing images used in the Jupyter Notebook.
4. gender_submission.csv: Sample submission file for the Kaggle Titanic competition.

### Getting Started:

git clone https://github.com/lavEche/titanic-classification.git
cd titanic-classification 

### Usage
- Open the titanic_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter or JupyterLab.
- Follow the code cells in the notebook to analyze the Titanic dataset, build and evaluate machine learning models.
- Use the model for predicting survival of passengers based on input data.

#### Features
The Titanic Classification System includes the following features:

- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Prediction of passenger survival
- Hyperparameter tuning

#### Model Evaluation
- The models have been evaluated using metrics like accuracy. The best-performing model is XGBoost with an accuracy of approximately 80%.

#### Deployment
- For a production-ready deployment, I used Flask.
#### Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements.
